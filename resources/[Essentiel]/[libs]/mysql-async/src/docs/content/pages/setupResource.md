#### Installing the Resource

 After you have installed a database, you will have to add the resource to the server. To do this, first  [download](https://github.com/brouznouf/fivem-mysql-async/releases) the *Source Code (zip)* then extract the contents to the /resources/ folder of your server configuration.

To learn more about configuring your server follow this [Link](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/) to the FiveM Documentation about the step-by-step guide on setting up FXServer.

After the resource has been extracted you will need to add `ensure mysql-async` to your server configuration, and proceed with configuring the resource.
